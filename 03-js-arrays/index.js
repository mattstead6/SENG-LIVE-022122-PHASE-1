// Understanding arrays

// What are arrays and how do they allow us to structure our data?

// Define a variable 'pokemon' set to an empty array.

// Rewrite the 'pokemon' array with the following elements: 'pikachu', 'bulbasour', 'jigglypuff'

// Elements:

// Return 'bulbasour' from the pokemon array

// Modifying elements:

// Add a new element 'mew' to the end of pokemon. There are 2 ways this can be accomplished. Which method is best practice and why?

// Add a new element 'Gloom' to the beginning of pokemon.

// Remove the first element of 'pokemon'

// Create a new array, 'favorites', that includes the first 2 elements from pokemon only and the following 2 new elements: 'squirtle', 'turtwig'.

// For the following exercises, comment in the following array:

// const pokemon = ["Bulbasaur","Ivysaur","Venusaur","Charmander","Charmeleon","Charizard","Squirtle","Wartortle","Blastoise","Caterpie","Metapod","Butterfree","Weedle","Kakuna","Beedrill","Pidgey","Raticate","Spearow","Fearow","Ekans","Arbok","Pikachu","Raichu","Sandshrew","Sandslash","Nidoran","Nidorina","Jigglypuff","Wigglytuff","Zubat","Golbat","Oddish","Gloom","Vileplume","Paras","Parasect","Venonat","Venomoth","Diglett","Dugtrio","Meowth","Persian","Psyduck","Golduck","Mankey","Primeape","Growlithe","Arcanine"]

// Iteration

// looping methods:

// for loop
// Define a for loop that will log each pokemon character to the console.

// for..of
// Rewrite the previous exercise using a for..of loop

// .forEach

// Use .forEach() to iteratate through the pokemon array and return each character name in large caps

// Searching an array: .find() vs .filter()

// Create a method that will return all pokemon characters that start with the letter 's'. Which array method should be used for this task?

// Modifying an elements in an array

// .map()

// Using map, return a new array with all pokemon character names lowercased.
